### spring-boot-admin-server
## - the Codecentric AG Spring Boot Admin server in the most modern form
## planned to be used together with projects rest-svc-db-client / rest-svc-sba-client
main point of experimentation is the authentication for both GUI and REST

The Maven pom now is equipped with the Fabric8 plugin for deploying to Kubernetes with no (minimal) descriptor files. These are generated by Fabric8 plugin.
We have the following Fabric8 maven plugin configurations via resource fragment files:
* /src/main/fabric8/__deployment.yml__ defines the liveness/readiness probe URIs from the K8s default of /health to /actuator/health/ . Any changes must be reflected in __SecurityConfig.java__ as well! The port number is somehow redundantly specified.
* /src/main/fabric8/__service.yml__ changes the type of the K8s service created from ClusterIP to NodePort (for easier access in the single-node minikube environment)
